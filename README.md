# TextBasedAdventure
'''
This is a text based adventure game, based on escaping a prison. In order to win the game, you are to try different combinations of responses, traveling to different cells, and finally confronting the guard! In order to fill in a response, simply type when prompted. If you are unsure of which words to use, it will allow multiple tries to find a command. Try using short commands, and if given, following the specific choices listed in some rooms.
