# TextBasedAdventure
'''
This is a text based adventure game, based on escaping the prison you are trapped in. In order to win the game, 
you must try different responses to leading questions, traveling to different cells, and finally confronting the guard
to escape the prison. In order to fill in a response, simply type when prompted. If you are unsure of which words to use, 
it will allow multiple tries to find a command. Try using short commands, and, if given, following the specific choices 
listed in some rooms.
